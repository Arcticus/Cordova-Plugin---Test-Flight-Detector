This allows a developer to use a single build and exercise separate code for testing versus production. \n\n## com.gosyntactix.cordova.testflightdetector\n\nThis plugin defines a global `TFDetect` object, which on app launch queries whether an app was installed via TestFlight or launched from XCode.  The launch from XCode works for both the Simulator and an attached USB device.\n\nAlthough the object is in the global scope, it is not available until after the `deviceready` event.\n\n    document.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", onDeviceReady, false);\n    function onDeviceReady() {\n        console.log(TFDetect.isRunningTestFlightBeta);\n    }\n\n### Installation\n\n    cordova plugin add com.gosyntactix.cordova.testflightdetector\n\n### Properties\n\n- TFDetect.isTFXC\n- TFDetect.isAppStore\n\n### TFDetect.isRunningTestFlightBeta\n\nReturns **<u>true</u>** if the app was installed via TestFlight or launched from XCode to an attached USB device or iOS Simulator.  Returns **<u>false</u>** if the app was installed via the official Apple App Store.\n\n#### Supported Platforms\n\n- iOS\n\n#### Quick Example\n   \n    if (TFDetect.isTFXC) {\n    \t//DEBUG CODE HERE\r    } else {\n    \t//PRODUCTION CODE HERE\r    }\n\n### TFDetect.isAppStore\n\nReturns **<u>true</u>** if the app was installed via the Apple App Store.  Returns **<u>false</u>** if the app was installed via TestFlight or launched from XCode to an attached USB device or iOS Simulator. \n\n#### Supported Platforms\n\n- iOS\n\n#### Quick Example\n   \n    if (TFDetect.isAppStore) {\n    \t//PRODUCTION CODE HERE\r    } else {\n    \t//DEBUG CODE HERE\r    }\n"
